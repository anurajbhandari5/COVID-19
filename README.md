Idea: 

In today's time, every information related to any field of study is available on the web. Multiple online courses are avialble for access on various portals either for free or at nominal costs. But there is definitely a hidden cost involved: that of the data packs and fast internet. Fast internet is not present at remote locations like villages and hilly areas, and also, not everyone can afford to have a wifi with unlimited monthly plan. 

So we propose to build: 
• A unique E-Learning Platform providing Live Classes as well as 
Resources like-notes for later access. 
This wil make use of Data Compression Techniques so that the information being written on one end on a medium like-smart board by a teacher can be transmitted to display units like-projector present at the students' end using minimal amount of data and even at slow speed in less time, which will make it almost a live classroom-like experience. 
We will also provide a service of speech to text translation from English to other languages like- Hindi and vice-versa for the ease of students unable to understand English and for easy doubt clearing process using speech to text and translation APIs. 


• We'll also implement course prediction and suggestion option 
(which course is best suited for a particular student) by measuring their progress in a particular course based on their responses to some questions asked and also with a little help of Artificial Intelligence. 

• Presence of other general features like- chatbot support for help, 
sets of solved and unsolved questions, indepth and easy explanations using real world examples and with the use of pictures will also be there.
